        <p>I used to believe<br>
        We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful<br>
        Somethin' beautiful<br>
        Selling a dream<br>
        Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle<br>
        On a miracle<br>
        Say, go through the darkest of days<br>
        Heaven's a heartbreak away<br>
        Never let you go, never let me down<br>
        Oh, it's been a hell of a ride<br>
        Driving the edge of a knife<br>
        Never let you go, never let me down<br>
        Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        I won't give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        I won't give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Oh, baby, baby</p>
